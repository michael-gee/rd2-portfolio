New and Improved Portfolio. Final Draft

This is my Final Draft of my portfolio although it is not yet completed, and even when it is "completed" I will be making constant changes and updates to it to make it better. 

To begin with I started created the front end of the Portfolio using HTML/CSS/Javascript.

I will later implement the back end using Node.js and other technologies when I have furthered my learning on those subjects.
